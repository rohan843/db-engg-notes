## ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity, Durability

### A Transaction

At its core, a transaction is a collection of SQL queries that are treated as **1 unit of work**.

SQL assumes a relational database, with tables. In such a system, our single logical piece of work would be split up in different queries and executed as a single unit.

E.g., money transfer from account A to B:

```sql
SELECT Account A balance  -- see if enough money present
UPDATE Account A balance  -- deduct money
UPDATE Account B balance  -- add money
```

#### Transaction Lifespan

A transaction always begins with the keyword `BEGIN`. This lets the DB know that a transaction with multiple queries is about to start.

Once the transaction has fully run, its changes should be made durable in the DB, i.e., a transaction `COMMIT` occurs.

In case we wish to undo the effect of a transaction, we perform a transaction `ROLLBACK`. This will also be needed in case the transaction ends unexpectedly, such as a crash.

#### Nature of Transactions

Usually transactions are used to change or modify data, but we may also have a read-only transaction.

> If the DB knows a transaction is read - only, it can optimize its execution.

As an example of a read-only transaction, consider a case where we may want a report generated, for which we need a consistent snapshot based on the time of the transaction. (This would come under _isolation_ to ensure no other transactions affect the data.)

e.g.:
We want $100 sent from account 1 to 2:

```sql
BEGIN TX1

  SELECT balance FROM account WHERE id=1;
  CHECK balance > 100;
    UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id=1;
    UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id=2;

COMMIT TX1
```

> In case we simply run a SQL command without the transaction explicitly defined, the DB implicitly defines the transaction before running it.
